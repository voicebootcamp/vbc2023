You can now display directly the list of Articles instead of displaying the list of Months and Years like the previous version did.\r\n+ Check first if a third party extension is active (installed or enabled), and then retrieve content from there, without displaying any errors.\r\n+ *STATE: You can choose a different type of article state to be displayed. You can either show all articles, the featured articles, the non-featured articles or both. The published or unpublished articles, the trashed articles, and of course the archived articles (from Joomla core functionality).\r\n+ *Custom Page Title and Welcome Message are now welcome. Another useful feature to set your custom texts for the page title and the welcome message for each content type (months\/years list or list of articles) separately. Also, you can hide the page title or the welcome message, again in each content-type separately.\r\n+ *Include\/Exclude content. Another great feature is to display any content you want to be displayed. You can choose which content items to include or exclude from your Archive, specific years, months, categories, authors, and articles. In the new version, the parameters are now displayed as a new separate tab in the component parameters.\r\n+ *UIkit Front-end framework: The layout has been improved spectacularly. It is based on the fantastic UIkit framework of Yootheme team. The UIkit is a lightweight and modular front-end framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.\r\n+ *SEARCH FORM: Choose the input form fields that will be displayed in the search form. Select those that are useful for your Users. You can show the date select field, the order select field, the author's select form field, and the search input text. Also, you can show\/hide each form field in each content-type separately.\r\n+ LAYOUT & NEW PARAMETERS: There are multiple new useful parameters to customize the layout for each content type separately, the list of months\/years and the list of articles. For example, you can choose if you want to display the years in an accordion style. You can select the ordering of years, most recent years first, or oldest years first. To avoid big lists, you can set your own limits (e.g. display only the three most recent years and their months).\r\n+ *IMAGES: We add more powerful parameters for images. You can show or hide the image. You can choose if your image will be displayed with a link or not. You can choose the image type (the intro image, the full, the auto-detect from the content item or the blank image). Finally, you can set your preferred image dimensions (width and height).\r\n+ *COMMENTS: This is a feature of a previous version but the functionality has been improved and optimized.\r\n+ *MODULE: The module has also been re-written from scratch with bug fixes, speed optimizations, and new features just as the component has.\r\n^ The language files have been changed.

        "stable_version": "4.0.2",

        "changelog": "+ Added   ! Removed   ^ Changed   # Fixed\r\n\r\n19-Jan-2021 : v4.0.2\r\n+ [New Parameter] Disable ReCaptcha cookies. By default the Invisible reCAPTCHA loads some required cookies. By setting this option to Yes you can disable the cookies of Invisible reCAPTCHA (screenshot: http:\/\/bit.ly\/disableReCAPTCHACookies).\r\n# [Bug Fixed] If you place HTML\/JS code inside cpnb tags with a custom category (e.g. <cpnb data-cpnb-cookie-category-id=\"analytical-cookies\">google analytics code goes here..<\/cpnb>) the content inside cpnb tags should be hidden when a User rejects the cookies.\r\n# [Bug Fixed] The CPNB tags and the Cookies Info shortcode is not working properly when the Joomla! cache is enabled.\r\n\r\n02-Dec-2020 : v4.0.1\r\n# [Bug Fixed] Error: 0 Class 'LanguageHelper' not found.\r\n# [Bug Fixed] Can't export\/import parameters since the last update (v4.0.0) [Thank you, Alex Giral]\r\n\r\n26-Nov-2020 : v4.0.0\r\n+ [J4 ready] Fully compatible with Joomla! 4.x. Almost, all the parameters in the backend works properly.\r\n+ [New Feature] Compatible with the Web357 Licenses Key Manager (https:\/\/bit.ly\/web357-license-key-manager)\r\n+ [Improvement] Compatible with the latest version 1.8.0 of Web357 Framework.\r\n^ [Improvement] By running Google Lighthouse test, we found a problem: the cpnb_outter, cpnb_inner and cpnb-modal-close ids are used twice in the rendered page while id attributes should be unique on a page. [Many thanks to Giussepe Covino]\r\n^ [Improvement] When a user entering the site on DE language, declines all cookies, change to UK. The next time the user entered the site they get send back to the DE site. The required-session cookies from core Language Filter system plugin are now ignored. [Many thanks to Esben Laursen]\r\n^ [Improvement] The \"cpnb-cookies-manager-icon-1-64x64.png\" icon is in the plugins folder, but since typically that this folder is forbidden by robots.txt, crawlers cannot download that icon, so the icon has been moved into the media folder. [Thank you, Giuse Covino]\r\n^ [Improvement] Add validation patterns for expiration time of cookies in the plugin parameters at Joomla! backend. (e.g. ^([1-9])[\\d]{0,3}$) You can enter only digits from 1 day up to 999 days.\r\n^ [Improvement] In the language files all the \"_QQ_\" strings, have been replaced with a single quote.\r\n^ [Improvement] The JFactory::getLanguage()->getKnownLanguages(); has been replaced with LanguageHelper::getKnownLanguages(JPATH_SITE);\r\n^ [Style Improvement] Fix \"lock overlay\" z-index to avoid clicking on menu items. [Thank you, Matthias Rost]\r\n# [Bug Fixed] Some issues with templates that has a sticky menu and place the notification bar at the top, are now resolved. [Thank you, Sch\u00f6ffel Tobias]\r\n# [Bug Fixed] Installation issues after installing the plugin on a clean Joomla! 4.0.0-alpha-12 installation.\r\n# Minor fixes, code cleanup and improvements.\r\n\r\n12-May-2020 : v3.9.1\r\n# [Bug Fixed] When you click the \"Accept\" button on Internet Explorer 11, nothing happens. [Thank you, Joachim Kroener]\r\n# [Bug fixed] PHP Notice: Undefined index: cpnb_cookiesSettings in \/cookiespolicynotificationbar.php on line 1009.\r\n^ [Improvement] If the user has not accepted the cookies policy, block the NID google's cookie which is loaded by the Joomla! core plugin \"plg_captcha_recaptcha_invisible\" [Thank you, Alexander]\r\n# [Bug Fixed] An issue in the templates section on the Yootheme PRO builder has been resolved. [Thank you, Gauliard Cathy]\r\n\r\n06-Mar-2020 : v3.9.0\r\n+ [New Feature] Admins are able to see which categories are accepted by the users via the acceptance logs in the plugin settings.\r\n+ [New Feature] Confirmation alerts for each button separately. In \"Base Settings\" you can see a new section of parameters \"Confirmation Alerts\", for the \"Accept\", for the \"Decline\", and for the \"Delete\" button.\r\n+ [New Feature] Restore the plugin settings to the defaults. All the settings will be replaced by the default plugin settings.\r\n+ [New Feature] The cookie expiration has been splitted in two variables, the datetime and the text. Now, if you are using the shortcode functionality to display the cookies info table, you can choose the Cookie expiration (count), and the cookie Expiration (text) (for example, 30 days, or 1 year, or 2 years, etc.)\r\n+ [New Parameter fields] You can now translate the expiration text values in the shortcode info table. You can do this from the \"Texts for Languages\" tab, for each language separately. There is a new field for each of these strings (minute, minutes, hour, hours, day, days, month, months, year, years).\r\n+ [New Feature] Add a class attribute for each button separately (accept, decline, cancel, more info, settings, save, reload), where these are displayed on the cookies notification bar, on the cookies manager (modal window) and in the cookies info table (shortcode). There are 11 buttons in total.\r\n# [New Feature] Because of some European countries, for example, Italy, a new parameter field has been created to set the days of the expiration date of the cookie \"cpnb_cookiesSettings\".\r\n# [New Feature] Trigger events are now available for each function separately. You can do something after clicking on the accept, on the decline, or on the cancel button. https:\/\/docs.web357.com\/article\/52-trigger-events\r\n+ [New Feature] The \"Include or Exclude from Pages\" functionality, in Advanced Settings, has been separated in two parameter sections. The \"Show Notification Bar\" and the \"Plugin's Functionality\". With the first parameter you can show\/hide the notification bar from specific pages, and with the second you can enable\/disable the whole plugin's functionality (notification bar, cookies manager modal window and cookies info table - shortcode functionality), from specific pages. [Thank you, Giuseppe Covino]\r\n^ [SEO Improvement] Some links are indexed automatically by search engine robots (e.g. Google, Bing, Baidu, Yandex, etc.). To avoid this situation we have add the attribute rel=\"nofollow\" to all the button links. [Thank you, Piero Pavan]\r\n^ [Style improvement] The checkbox style has been replaced by the classic checkbox style.\r\n^ [Language updated] The French language files have been updated. Many thanks to Sandra Decoux (sandra@idimweb.com) for her contribution.\r\n# [Bug Fixed] Detect the total of enabled cookie categories and if there are more than one, then create the \"cpnb_cookiesSettings\" cookie. If there is only one category (e.g. the \"required-cookies\"), do not create the \"cpnb_cookiesSettings\" cookie, to help you passing the Cookiebot validation service.\r\n# [Bug Fixed] after accept check all checkboxes asynchronously. Not reload needed as before.\r\n# [Bug Fixed] In the \"Block Cookies by blocking their Javascript Code\" parameters section it is not possible to have no one item.\r\n# Minor improvements and code cleanup.\r\n\r\n13-Jan-2020 : v3.8.3\r\n+ [New parameter] Show or Hide the Cookies Manager (Modal Window) to the Logged in Users.\r\n# [Improvement] Do not load the cookie name \"cpnb_cookiesSettings\" by default, but set enable only the required cookie category if the setting cookie is not initially loaded. This improvement has been added to pass the cookiebot service. Learn more here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/pass-cookiebot-validation-in-joomla\r\n# [Bug Fixed] Do not delete the allowed forced cookies if you click on the \"Decline\" button, inside the Cookies Manager (modal window) [Many thanks to Alexis Kourkoulos]\r\n# Minor fixes and improvements.\r\n\r\n06-Sep-2019 : v3.8.2\r\n+ [New feature] Force allow cookies.
