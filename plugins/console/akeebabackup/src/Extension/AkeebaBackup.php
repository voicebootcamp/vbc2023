			 * class FQN we will be trying to instantiate.
			 *
			 * However, some hosts create copies of the files e.g. copying or renaming FooBar.php to FooBar.01.php or
			 * even FooBar_01.php. This is something we've seen and documented since 2013, mostly attributed to some
			 * hosts' really broken file scanners. These files would create invalid class names. Since these class names
			 * do not exist, trying to instantiate them will fail with a RuntimeException from the factory. We catch
			 * this and move on, ignoring the bad file.
			 *
			 * Further to that, it's possible that a different combination of unforeseen mistakes by the host and / or
			 * Joomla (e.g. not all files copied correctly on update) causing one or more CLI command classes to error
			 * out. This is why we are catching Throwable instead of just RuntimeException.
